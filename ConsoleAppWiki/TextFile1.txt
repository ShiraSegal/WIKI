query: insert into [PLACE_WIKI_TEST] values (N'Sofia ( SOH-fee-\u0259, SOF-; Bulgarian: \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, romanized: Sofiya, IPA: [\u02c8s\u0254fij\u0250] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria. It is situated in the Sofia Valley at the foot of the Vitosha mountain in the western parts of the country. The city is built west of the Iskar river, and has many mineral springs, such as the Sofia Central Mineral Baths. It has a humid continental climate. Being in the centre of the Balkans, it is midway between the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea, and closest to the Aegean Sea.Known as Serdica in Antiquity and Sredets in the Middle Ages, Sofia has been an area of human habitation since at least 7000 BC. The recorded history of the city begins with the attestation of the conquest of Serdica by the Roman Republic in 29 BC from the Celtic tribe Serdi. During the decline of the Roman Empire, the city was raided by Huns, Visigoths, Avars and Slavs. In 809, Serdica was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets. In 1018, the Byzantines ended Bulgarian rule until 1194, when it was reincorporated by the reborn Bulgarian Empire. Sredets became a major administrative, economic, cultural and literary hub until its conquest by the Ottomans in 1382. From 1530 to 1836, Sofia was the regional capital of Rumelia Eyalet, the Ottoman Empire''s key province in Europe. Bulgarian rule was restored in 1878. Sofia was selected as the capital of the Third Bulgarian State in the next year, ushering a period of intense demographic and economic growth.\nSofia is the 13th largest city in the European Union. It is surrounded by mountainsides, such as Vitosha by the southern side, Lyulin by the western side, and the Balkan Mountains by the north, which makes it the third highest European capital after Andorra la Vella and Madrid. Being Bulgaria''s primate city, Sofia is home of many of the major local universities, cultural institutions and commercial companies. The city has been described as the \"triangle of religious tolerance\". This is due to the fact that three temples of three major world religions\u2014Christianity, Islam and Judaism\u2014are situated close together: Sveta Nedelya Church, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue. This triangle was recently expanded to a \"square\" and includes the Catholic Cathedral of St Joseph.Sofia has been named one of the top ten best places for start-up businesses in the world, especially in information technologies. It was Europe''s most affordable capital to visit in 2013. In 1979, the Boyana Church in Sofia was included onto the World Heritage List, and it was deconstructed in the Second Bulgarian Empire, holding much patrimonial symbolism to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. With its cultural significance in Southeast Europe, Sofia is home to the National Opera and Ballet of Bulgaria, the National Palace of Culture, the Vasil Levski National Stadium, the Ivan Vazov National Theatre, the National Archaeological Museum, and the Serdica Amphitheatre. The Museum of Socialist Art includes many sculptures and posters that educate visitors about the lifestyle in communist Bulgaria.The population of Sofia declined from 70,000 in the late 18th century, through 19,000 in 1870, to 11,649 in 1878, after which it began increasing. Sofia hosts some 1.24 million residents within a territory of 492 km2, a concentration of 17.9% of the country population within the 200th percentile of the country territory. The urban area of Sofia hosts some 1.54 million residents within 5723 km2, which comprises Sofia City Province and parts of Sofia Province (Dragoman, Slivnitsa, Kostinbrod, Bozhurishte, Svoge, Elin Pelin, Gorna Malina, Ihtiman, Kostenets) and Pernik Province (Pernik, Radomir), representing 5.16% of the country territory. The metropolitan area of Sofia is based upon one hour of car travel time, stretches internationally and includes Dimitrovgrad in Serbia. The metropolitan region of Sofia is inhabited by a population of 1.66 million.',N'Sofiya','10631990','en')

It is located 18 km (11 mi) east of Radvili\u0161kis.\n\u0160eduva was an agricultural town dealing in  cereals, flax and linseed, pigs and geese and horses, at the site of a royal estate and beside a road from Kaunas to Riga.   The population from the fifteenth century was Catholic and Jewish. Until then, Lithuania had been the last pagan kingdom in Europe and allowed freedom of worship and toleration of Jews and other religions. The first Catholic shrine of \u0160eduva, the Church of the Invention of the Holy Cross, was built and the parish founded between 1512 and 1529.  The present brick church Cross was built in \u0160eduva in 1643 with a donation from bishop Jurgis Ti\u0161kevi\u010dius of Vilnius. During the 18th century the bell tower was added to the structure, with further renovations and extensions in 1905.  Baroque and renaissance architectural styles characterise both the exterior and interior of the church. It has a cruciform plan with an apse, low sacristy and five altars.\nDuring the 15th century the region was redefined as the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius. Later it became part of  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Union of Lublin in 1569 created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\nThe \u0160eduva coat of arms were granted on June 25, 1654 by John II Casimir Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and at the same time the city was granted burger rights at the request of Maria Ludvika, Queen of Poland. She descended from the Princes of Gonzaga, from Mantua in Italy. The arms of the family showed a black eagle. The small breastshield shows the French fleur-de-lis, because the Gonzaga family was related to the French Royal family.  The eagle was made white in reference to the white eagle of Poland.\n\n1792 Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last royal proprietor of \u0160eduva, concluded an agreement with the town''s citizens, giving them rights to be excused from labour on the estate for a fee.  In 1795, the year of a terrible fire in \u0160eduva,  Lithuania became part of Russia when Poland was partitioned.  From 1798, Baron Theodore von Ropp did not acknowledge the rights of \u0160eduva citizens and required of the citizens to perform labour in the town''s manor. The citizens  petitioned for their rights  to the Russian Senate. In 1812, the Senate passed the decision to recognise the former charters of \u0160eduva.\nBetween 1696 and 1762, a Jesuit mission, connected with their college at Pa\u0161iau\u0161\u0117, was active in the town, operating a lower school with 96 pupils up until 1828.  After an insurrection in 1863 (the January Uprising), all parish schools in \u0160eduva were closed and replaced by public Russian language schools. In the same year a Russian Orthodox Church, designed by the architect Ustinas Golinevicius, was built and in 1866 a wooden Synagogue was added near the central market square.\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia  in August 1939 and the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty a month later placed Lithuania under  Soviet control.   By June 1940 the Soviets had set up a pro-Soviet government and stationed many Red Army troops in Lithuania as part of the Mutual Assistance Pact between the countries. President Antanas Smetona was forced to leave as 15 Red Army divisions came in.\nThe  pro-Soviet puppet government was controlled by Vladimir Dekanozov and Justas Paleckis, and Lithuania was made part of the  Soviet Union. A Sovietisation programme began immediately. Land, banks and large businesses were nationalised. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were abolished except the Communist party. 17,000 people  were deported to Siberia, where many would perish.\nDuring the years of Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisan resistance (1944\u20131953) in \u0160eduva and neighbouring districts Lithuanian \u017dalioji rinktin\u0117 (The Green Squad), belonging to partisans'' Algimantas military district was active.\n\n',N'Seduva','10711433','en')
